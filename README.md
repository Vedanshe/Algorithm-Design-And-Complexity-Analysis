# Algorithm-Design-And-Complexity-Analysis
The major goal for building this project was to identify problems from the real-world and design an algorithm in order to solve them. The problem identified was; in banks testing for safety is required before passing any loan by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then making a safe-state check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending cases. The classical banker's algorithm of Dijkstra for resource allocation guarantees freedom from deadlock by deny- ing requests for resources that lead to unsafe allocation.
